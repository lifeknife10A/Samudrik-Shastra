"""
One-time clean-up of the figure rules into "condition / meaning" pairs.

The template reading prints one rule per sentence, which reads awkwardly when
the extraction put a noun phrase in the observation or a fragment in the
prediction. This script asks the local model to rewrite each usable figure
rule as:

    condition: a clause that can follow "when" and holds a verb
    meaning:   one or two sentences saying what the book says it indicates

Nothing is invented: the model sees the rule and the figure's own passage and
may use only words and facts from them. Every answer is then validated in
code, and a rejected answer leaves the original rule in place.

Usage:
    python3 engine/clean_figure_rules.py            # clean every figure
    python3 engine/clean_figure_rules.py --limit 5  # first 5 figures only
    python3 engine/clean_figure_rules.py --needs-review  # write the check list

Output:
    engine/figure_rules_clean.json    used by the reader
    engine/figure_rules_review.md     original vs cleaned, for checking
    engine/needs_review.md            the entries a check cannot settle

Re-running skips figures already in the output file, so a long run can be
resumed. knowledge_base.json and figure_index.json are never written.

### Health line figure 1: "vague and indistinct" vs "deep, long, and clear"

The prediction "must remain cautious" belongs to the **deep, long, and clear**
line, not to the vague one.

English, printed page 135 (PDF 35):

> Individuals in whose hands the Health Line is completely absent are
> generally healthy and robust. Those who possess a distinct Health Line
> experience its influence in the form of ailments gradually taking root in
> their bodies, and therefore, they must remain cautious.

Hindi, printed page 135 (PDF 35):

> जिन प्राणियों के हाथों में स्वास्थ्य रेखा बिलकुल ही नहीं होती वह निरोग और
> बलिष्ठ होते हैं। जिनके हाथ में स्पष्ट स्वास्थ्य रेखा होती हैं उसका प्रभाव
> होता है कि उनके शरीर में धीरे २ रोग घर करने लगा है अतः उन्हें सचेत हो जाना
> चाहिए।

"स्पष्ट" is the word the English page translates as "distinct", and "सचेत" is
"cautious", so the caution sentence is about the clear line. The same page
says what happens to a line that fades:

> Generally speaking, the Health Line serves as a measure of the Life Line and
> is prone to frequent changes. When a person falls ill, this line becomes
> deep and ominous, and as the individual gradually recovers their health, the
> line tends to fade away.

> जब मनुष्य रोग ग्रस्त होता है तो यह गहरी और भयानक होती है और जैसे २ प्राणी
> निरोग होता जाता है वैसे २ यह गायब होती जाती है।

- **rule_35_2 ("deep, long, and clear")**: the caution prediction is correct,
  so nothing changed. It prints "such a person must remain cautious".
- **rule_35_1 ("vague and indistinct")**: the book attaches no caution to this
  form, so the entry was **changed**. It used to print the caution prediction
  (which belongs to the other rule); it now prints the page's own words for a
  faint line.
  - Before: status `original`, no meaning -> "such a person must remain
    cautious".
  - After: status `from_passage`, meaning "the book lists it among the forms
    the Health Line takes, appearing vague and indistinct in many hands while
    in some it is deep, long, and clear, and it fades away as a person
    recovers their health" (kept 71% of the passage sentence's words).

### Fate line rule_88_0: a break in the Fate Line (figures 4 and 5)

English, printed page 183 (PDF 87):

> The individual whose Fate Line is broken finds their progress cast into
> doubt, for progress does not occur instantaneously. It begins from a humble
> level, and just when the apex or time of advancement arrives, a halt occurs.
> In such a state, progress comes to a standstill.

Hindi, printed page 183 (PDF 87):

> जिस प्राणी की भाग्य रेखा टूट जाती है उसकी उन्नति में सन्देह होता है क्योंकि
> उन्नति एकदम तो होती नहीं। ... जब उन्नति का बिन्दु अथवा समय आता है तो उसमें
> विराम हो जाता है

English, printed page 184 (PDF 88), the sentence the meaning was checked
against:

> remains right where it is. For this reason, a break in the Fate Line is
> considered inauspicious. (Figure 4, Line 2-1, the middle point 1)

Hindi, printed page 184 (PDF 88):

> जहाँ की तहाँ रह जाती है। इस कारण भाग्य रेखा का टूटना अच्छा नहीं होता।

- **Figure 4**: the old meaning ended "the break indicates instability and
  failure to achieve true success". Those words are not about a break. They
  come from the Line 1-3 passage on printed page 182, which describes a Fate
  Line that is "clear, deep, and distinct" and says "their thoughts lack
  stability" and "they fail to achieve true success". The entry was
  **changed** to what the break's own two sentences say.
  - Before: "the book says that such a person is considered inauspicious, as
    the break indicates instability and failure to achieve true success".
  - After: "the book says that such a person is considered inauspicious, as
    the break casts their progress into doubt and their advancement comes to a
    standstill" (kept 50% of the passage sentence's words).
- **Figure 5**: figure 5's own paragraph (printed page 184, Figure 5 locations,
  and printed page 186) is about an island mark and a snake-tongue fork, and
  the break sentence is labelled "(Figure 4, Line 2-1 ...)". So the break
  answer does not come from figure 5's text. The copy could not be changed on
  its own: the reader keeps one cleaned entry per rule id and refuses a file
  where one id carries two different statuses (tried: it made the reader
  refuse the whole file, and six more figures lost their text). Both copies
  now hold the corrected figure 4 answer, which is the page 184 sentence for
  the rule itself.
  - **Needs the user:** whether figure 5 should carry this rule at all is a
    question about `figure_index.json`, which is out of bounds here.

### Health line figure 4, rule_38_2 (`from_passage`)

English, printed page 138 (PDF 38):

> If an individual's Health Line is straight, long, and clear, its results are
> auspicious.

> The greatest beneficial effect of this Subsidiary Health Line is that if
> there are any defects or flaws within the Health Line itself, this auxiliary
> line nullifies those blemishes and yields auspicious results. (Refer to the
> lines marked 1-1 and 1-2 in Figure No. 4.)

Hindi, printed page 138 (PDF 38):

> यदि किसी प्राणी के हाथ की स्वास्थ्य रेखा सीधी लम्बी और साफ है तो उसका फल
> शुभ होता है।

> अगर स्वास्थ्य रेखा में कोई अवगुण भी हैं तो उस अवगुण को स्वास्थ्य रेखा की
> सहायक रेखा नाश कर देती है और शुभ फल देती है।

- **No change.** The meaning uses both sentences of its own figure, and the
  figure shows both lines it names (1-1 the Health Line, 1-2 the Subsidiary
  Health Line), so it matches the passage.
